# AllerGen

AllerGen allows you to create a profile with a list of things you are allergic to. You can then scan foods, and it will show the ingredient list and determine whether or not you are allergic to it. You can also create a list of foods and then find the common ingredients to see which ingredient is causing the allergic reaction.
